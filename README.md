# 🧠 Recognizing Handwritten Numbers on Checks

This project focuses on **recognizing handwritten digits** (such as amounts on bank checks) using **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** techniques. The goal is to automate the process of reading and verifying handwritten numerical data, improving efficiency and accuracy in financial and document processing systems.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Bank checks often contain handwritten amounts that must be read accurately by machines.  
This project builds a **digit recognition system** that can identify handwritten numbers from images using trained models — similar to how the **MNIST dataset** is used for handwritten digit classification.

## 🧩 Key Features

- 🖼️ Preprocessing of scanned check images  
- ✂️ ROI (Region of Interest) extraction for handwritten areas  
- 🔢 Digit segmentation and normalization  
- 🤖 Model training using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**  
- 📊 Accuracy evaluation on validation/test datasets  
- 💾 Save and load trained models for reuse  
- 🧪 Test the model on custom check images

## 🧠 Tech Stack

| Category | Tools / Libraries |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Programming Language** | Python |
| **Deep Learning** | PyTorch, Scikit-learn |
| **Dataset** | MNIST |
| **Development** | Jupyter Notebook / VS Code |





## 📈 Results

* **Model Accuracy:** ~99% on MNIST dataset
* **Model Type:** CNN with ReLU activations and softmax output

## 🔍 Future Enhancements

* ✅ Support for recognizing **entire numeric strings** (multi-digit check amounts)
* ✅ Integration with OCR tools (e.g., Tesseract)
* ✅ Deploy as a **web app** using Streamlit or Flask
* ✅ Add model explainability with Grad-CAM
